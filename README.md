# Molecular Dynamics Simulations

## Description
This repository contains several Python scripts that perform molecular dynamics simulations and related calculations of theory of dislocations.

## Scripts
1. **Angle_Calculation.py** - Calculates the angle between partial dislocations and their Burgers vector.
2. **FCC_structure.py** - Generates an FCC lattice structure based on specified parameters.
3. **FCC_Structure_Other_Direction.py** - Generates FCC structure considering different orientation and directions.
4. **MD_Simulation.py** - Runs a full molecular dynamics simulation using predefined potential and integration methods.
5. **Stacking_Fault_Calculations.py** - Calculates the energy of stacking faults within FCC-crystalline structures.
